# Conqueror - for building scalable & maintainable .NET applications

**Conqueror** is a set of libraries that helps you build .NET applications in a structured way (using patterns like [command-query separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation), [publish-subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern), [stream processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing), etc.), while keeping them scalable (both at development time as well as runtime).

See our [quickstart](quickstart) or [example projects](examples) if you want to jump right into using **Conqueror** by code examples. Or head over to our [recipes](#recipes) for more detailed guidance on how you can utilize **Conqueror** to its maximum.
